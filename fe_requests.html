Go there, to the boss room (where you fought Garrick/Gojuin in the Prologue), where you will find Nieg surrounded by two savage mirages. It is there that the request is formally offered. Once accepted, fight the battle, and then return to Illusory Urahara and talk to Nieg to complete the quest.</p><p><strong>Battle</strong>: L48 Poltergeist x3</p><p><strong>Poltergeist</strong> (L48, 950HP, 330EP, 159 Attack, 46 Armor, 36/69/34/61/46/51)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Sword, Ice; <strong>Rs</strong>: Lance, Axe, Elec, Force, Mind, Body; <strong>Nu</strong>: Fire<br><strong>Command</strong>: Agilao, Maragi, Pulinpa; <strong>Session</strong>: Wind-Fire, Flame-Fire</p><h4>48.

You will need to recruit 10 different mirages from various places.

The mirages are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Mitesh</strong> (Dark Cleric): Chapter 1 - Illusory Daitama - Lower Level</li><li><strong>Piffin</strong> (Apparition): Chapter 2 - Illusory 106 - 6F</li><li><strong>Gainey</strong> (Nickelwise): Chapter 3 - Illusory Shibuya - 3rd section, 2F</li><li><strong>Rexer</strong> (Caspar): Chapter 4 - Illusory Daitou TV - Film Set A, 2F</li><li><strong>Boney</strong> (Skellington): Chapter 5 - Illusory Daiba Studio - LCD Screens</li><li><strong>Kiyo</strong> (Samantha): Chapter 6 - Illusory Daitou TV - Film Set B, 1F</li><li><strong>Bayon</strong> (Troll): Chapter 6 - Illusory Daiba Studio - Right side monitor room</li><li><strong>Naranash</strong> (Pale Bishop): Chapter 6 - Illusory 106 - B3F</li><li><strong>Ogar</strong> (Cerberus): Chapter 6 - Illusory Dolhr - 232m after clearing 333m first</li><li><strong>Nieg</strong> (Phantom): Chapter 1 - Harajuku - near Crepes Dia</li></ul><p>Once recruited, they will assemble from clockwise (left to right) in the order listed above, starting with Mitesh to the left of the entrance and ending with Nieg on the right.</p><h5>49. Versus Grandmaster Mirage!<a id="49. Versus Grandmaster Mirage!"></a></h5><p>Chapter 1 (NG+)<br>Illusory Daitama - Lower Level<br><strong>Reward</strong>: Detritus x30</p><p>In this request, you will need to get the six Dojo Signs from the Mirage Dojo masters. (Fun fact: the kanji on the sign literally reads "Mirage Dojo", using a phonetic transliteration of "mirage") There is one in each of the six dungeons, and their locations are clearly marked on the map. Defeating each master awards their Dojo Sign, as well as 10 units of detritus.</p><p>Alpha (Illusory 106)<br>L63 (3810HP, 400EP, 200 Attack, 64 Armor, 120/90/90/55/64/64)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Elec; <strong>Rs</strong>: Sword, Lance, Axe, Bow; <strong>Nu</strong>: Mind, Body<br><strong>Command</strong>: Attack, Tarukaja, Rakukaja, Sukukaja, Debilitate</p><p>The Illusory 106 battle is fairly rudimentary; the master's attempts to buff and debuff can be neutralized with Dekaja/Dekunda.</p><p>Beta (Illusory Shibuya)<br>L64 (6470HP, 0EP, 205 Attack, 64 Armor, 100/90/90/55/64/64)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Sword, Lance, Axe; <strong>Rs</strong>: Fire, Ice, Elec, Force; <strong>Nu</strong>: Mind, Body<br><strong>Command</strong>: Attack; <strong>Passive</strong>: Revenge Arts</p><p>In the Illusory Shibuya battle, you can session off the "physical types", but you run the risk of retaliation. Of course, you can mitigate its effects with Tarunda/Rakukaja, or set up Attack Mirrors...</p><p>Gamma (Illusory Daitou TV)<br>L65 (8440 HP, 340 EP, 210 Attack, 66 Armor, 100/120/90/55/66/66)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Elec; <strong>Nu</strong>: Fire, Mind, Body; <strong>Rp</strong>: Ice<br><strong>Command</strong>: Attack, Spirit Leech, Life Leech</p><p>In the Illusory Daitou TV battle, the master will generally alternate between attacking and draining. If you are going to use Attack Mirrors and Magic Mirrors, remember that both draining moves run off of magic, and Attack is physical.</p><p>Delta (Illusory Daiba Studio)<br>L66 (8900 HP, 450 EP, 215 Attack, 66 Armor, 110/110/90/40/66/66)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Ice; <strong>Nu</strong>: Lance, Elec, Mind, Body<br><strong>Command</strong>: (&#33075;&#22825;&#30452;&#25731;&#25331;), Marin Karin, Pulinpa, Makajam, (&#22823;&#12356;&#12394;&#12427;&#24746;&#24847;)</p><p>In the Illusory Daiba Studio battle, expect to be statused a whole lot (or not, if you are on lower difficulty levels, since status ailments are less likely to hit on lower difficulty levels). "Raindrop Memories" can buy a few rounds of attacking time.</p><p>Epsilon (Illusory Memories)<br>L67 (4130 HP, 120 EP, 220 Attack, 125 Armor, 125/90/90/50/68/68)<br><strong>Nu</strong>: everything<br><strong>Command</strong>: Attack, Charge</p><p>Disciple<br>L62 (no data)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Fire, Ice, Elec, Force; <strong>Rs</strong>: Sword, Lance, Axe, Bow; <strong>Nu</strong>: Mind, Body<br><strong>Command</strong>: Attack, Charge</p><p>In the Illusory Memories battle, the intent is that the master is immune to all forms of command skills (you can still use SPs, Duo Arts, and Ad-libs to damage directly), and the main method of inflicting damage is to wait until the disciples spawn, and damage the master from overkilling the disciples.</p><p>Zeta (Illusory Dolhr)<br>L68 (5000 HP, 360 EP, 225 Attack, 68 Armor, 70/90/90/30/68/68)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Fire; <strong>Nu</strong>: Mind, Body; <strong>Dr</strong>: Elec, Force<br><strong>Command</strong>: Megidolaon, Diarahan</p><p>In the Illusory Dolhr battle, expect to see some abuse of Diarahan. If the master is damaged and has one move left, it will use Diarahan to restore itself; otherwise it will use Megidolaon. This means that you have take out all of its HP in the three turns you have ahead of it (and you will have three turns, thanks to 30 Spd). If you are having trouble, use "Strike a Pose" to get extra turns for everyone, and use attacks powered by Charge or Concentrate. Charge and Concentrate multiply the damage output by 2.5x, and thus is better than simply attacking twice.</p><p>Once you have defeated all six masters and taken their Dojo Signs, return to the grandmaster at Illusory Daitama for one last battle.</p><p>Grandmaster (Illusory Daitama)<br>L70 (18000 HP, 600 EP, 230 Attack, 70 Armor, 150/300/90/55/70/70)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Sword; <strong>Rs</strong>: Fire, Ice, Elec, Force; <strong>Nu</strong>: Mind, Body<br><strong>Command</strong>: Bolganone, Fimbulvetr, Thoron, Excalibur, Megidolaon, Concentrate</p><p>Of note is that grandmaster has all four of the "severe" (168BP) tier attacks, all of which are named after Fire Emblem tomes rather than following the SMT conventions of spell names (the SMT series generally lack a naming convention for magic attacks above the heavy "-dyne" level). The grandmaster will cycle between Thoron, Excalibur, Bolganone, and Fimbulvetr, in that order, and target a different person (cycling between Itsuki, the person on Itsuki's left, and the person on Itsuki's right) each turn, until its HP is in the red. Once its HP goes into the red, the grandmaster will simply spam concentrated Megidolaon until it dies.</p><h4>50. The Dragon Descends<a id="50. The Dragon Descends"></a></h4><p>Chapter 2 Intermission (NG+) - Complete 47, and talk to Nieg after trading detritus 36 times<br>Illusory Urahara<br><strong>Reward</strong>: Lck Incense</p><p>In the proud tradition of SMT games, this consists of nothing but battling the secret final boss. Note that once you have accepted the request, you do not have to fight the secret final boss immediately. Also, although defeating this boss completes the request, you are free to challenge this boss as many times as you want. (This is not considered repeating the request.)</p><p><strong>M-DEUS</strong> (L99, 32767HP, 18000EP, 340 Attack, 95 Armor, 140/130/120/98/95/90)<br><strong>Command</strong>: Tail, Giant Fang, Energy Drain, Dark Breath, Dies Irae, (&#39764;&#31452;&#12398;&#30002;&#27579;), Maragidyne, Bolganone, Thunder Strike, Unstable Ground</p><p><strong>Bulwark Swordmaster</strong> (L95, 4500HP, 500EP, 290 Attack, 95 Armor, 130/92/150/120/95/92)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Lance, Elec, Body; <strong>Rs</strong>: Sword, Bow, Fire, Ice, Force; <strong>Nu</strong>: Mind; <strong>Rp</strong>: Axe<br><strong>Command</strong>: Focused Blade, Wallbreaker, Charge; <strong>Session</strong>: Sword-Slash EX; <strong>Passive</strong>: Pierce, (&#27671;&#32118;&#20184;&#21152;)</p><p><strong>Bulwark General</strong> (L95, 8000HP, 500EP, 350 Attack, 180 Armor, 128/105/110/56/180/30)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Sword, Fire, Ice, Force, Mind; <strong>Rs</strong>: Bow; <strong>Nu</strong>: Axe, Body; <strong>Rp</strong>: Lance, Elec<br><strong>Command</strong>: Gigantomachia, Wallbreaker, Dekaja; <strong>Session</strong>: Axe-Split EX, Elec-Split EX</p><p><strong>Bulwark Wyvern Lord</strong> (L95, 4000HP, 500EP, 300 Attack, 90 Armor, 120/140/120/81/90/88)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Axe, Bow, Ice, Force; <strong>Rs</strong>: Lance, Elec, Mind, Body; <strong>Nu</strong>: Sword; Rp: Fire<br><strong>Command</strong>: Javelin Rain, Corrupting Flare, War Cry; <strong>Session</strong>: Lance-Pierce EX, Axe-Pierce EX, Fire-Pierce EX</p><p><strong>Bulwark Bishop</strong> (L95, 3000HP, 500EP, 280 Attack, 95 Armor, 46/130/60/40/95/95)<br><strong>Wk</strong>: Sword; <strong>Rs</strong>: Bow, Ice, Force, Mind, Body; <strong>Rp</strong>: Fire, Elec<br><strong>Command</strong>: Mediarahan, Tetrakarn, Mazandyne, Nosferatu; <strong>Session</strong>: Wind-Elblizzard</p><p>The affinities of M-DEUS depends on which minions are on the field. With no minions on the field, your only chance of sessions are essentially SP attacks (including ad-libs and Duo Arts) and Itsuki's Wyrmslayer/Wyrmicide.</p><table class="ffaq" style="height: 156px;" width="1084"><thead><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Sword</td><td>Lance</td><td>Axe</td><td>Bow</td><td>Fire</td><td>Ice</td><td>Elec</td><td>Force</td><td>Mind</td><td>Body</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>No minions</td><td>Rp</td><td>Rp</td><td>Rp</td><td>Rp</td><td>Rp</td><td>Rp</td><td>Rp</td><td>Rp</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Nu</td></tr><tr><td>Bulwark Swordmaster</td><td>Nu</td><td>Nu</td><td>Wk</td><td>Wk</td><td>Nu</td><td>Nu</td><td>Wk</td><td>Nu</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Nu</td></tr><tr><td>Bulwark General</td><td>Wk</td><td>Wk</td><td>Nu</td><td>Nu</td><td>Nu</td><td>Nu</td><td>Nu</td><td>Wk</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Nu</td></tr><tr><td>Bulwark Wyvern Lord</td><td>Nu</td><td>Nu</td><td>Wk</td><td>Wk</td><td>Nu</td><td>Wk</td><td>Nu</td><td>Wk</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Nu</td></tr><tr><td>Bulwark Bishop</td><td>Nu</td><td>Nu</td><td>Nu</td><td>Nu</td><td>Wk</td><td>Wk</td><td>Wk</td><td>Wk</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Nu</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The reinforcement waves will appear in the following order, as M-DEUS's HP decreases (in all cases, two minions will appear):</p><ul><li>Bulwark Swordmaster</li><li>Bulwark General</li><li>Bulwark Swordmaster</li><li>Bulwark General</li><li>Bulwark Wyvern Lord</li><li>Bulwark Swordmaster</li><li>Bulwark Wyvern Lord</li><li>Bulwark Wyvern Lord</li><li>Bulwark Bishop</li><li>Bulwark Bishop</li></ul><p>Note that you may be able to skip some waves entirely if you can inflict enough damage to cross two or more HP thresholds.</p><p>Regardless of how you attack M-DEUS, the most damage you can do with one attack to it is 499HP. It is in your best interest to destroy the minions (especially the Bulwark Bishops, as they have Mediarahan) rather than capitalize on weaknesses in M-DEUS, as the enemy will sacrifice any remaining minions three turns after they are summoned to power up Dies Irae, which, beyond a certain point, will OHKO your team (as an Almighty attack, you can't really block against it). M-DEUS will use Dies Irae on the third turn, and every fourth turn thereafter. Furthermore, M-DEUS will use Energy Drain on the turn before Dies Irae.</p><p>In terms of recommended stat spreads, it is possible to defeat M-DEUS on Friendly with as little as 100 in all stats, though it is recommended that you run at least 160 Spd, 130 Str/Mag, 170 Skl, and 130 Def/Res for everyone at higher difficulties.</p><h2>References<a id="References"></a></h2><p>Detailed enemy information was obtained from Japanese FAQ sources, including Omoteura (http://omoteura.com/sharpfe) and Spwiki (http://spwikinet/sharpfe), and translated here. &nbsp;Additional information was obtained from firsthand gameplay.</p></div>
